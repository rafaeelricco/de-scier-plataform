# Modules directory

The `Modules` directory is an integral part of the application's structure, designed to organize and manage the various resources and components of the application. It serves as a container for all distinct modules that represent specific functionalities or pages within the application.

## Purpose and organization

Each module within this directory encapsulates all the necessary components, logic, and styles for a specific functionality or page of the application. This modular approach ensures that each feature is self-contained, making the application easier to maintain and scale.

### components within Modules

The `Modules` directory typically includes components that are:

-  **Resource-specific**: components that are unique to a specific functionality or page of the application.
-  **Self-contained**: components that encapsulate all the necessary functionality and styling for a feature, minimizing dependencies on external modules.
-  **Reusable within the module**: components that can be reused in different parts of the same module.

### Examples of modules

-  **`Home`**: Contains components such as `Index`, `ArticleCard`, `BannerStartPublishing`, and `Search`, with subcomponents `ArticleAccess`, `ArticleItem`, and `Purchase`. This module encapsulates all aspects of the Home functionality of the application.
-  **`Profile`**, **`Login`**, **`Register`**, etc.: Each of these modules contains components specific to their respective functionalities, such as `Modals` in `Profile` and `Animation`, `Modals` in `Login`.

## Guidelines for including components

In the `Modules` directory, only the following types of components should be placed:

-  **Page components**: These serve as the main structure or layout of a specific page of the application.
-  **Functionality components**: These implement a specific functionality that is integral to a module or page.
-  **Complex and specific components**: These are unique to a module and are not shared among other modules.
-  **Business logic components**: These encapsulate domain-specific logic related to a particular module of the application.

This guideline helps maintain clarity and organization in the code, ensuring that the components within `Modules` are relevant, specific, and contribute to the core functionality of the module to which they belong.
